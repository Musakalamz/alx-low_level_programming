# C - Debugging 

In this project, I learned about  debugging as been the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly.. I also learned some methods of debugging manually and how to read the error messages. 

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files. Provided by ALX Africa..

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all
functions written in the project.

| File                     | Prototype                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `0-main.c`           | 'void positive_or_negative(int i);`     |
| `1-main.c` | `commenting out against infinite loop` |
| `2-largest_number.c `          | `int largest_number(int a, int b, int c);`           |
| `3-print_remaining_days.c`            |'int convert_day(int month, int day);'   `void print_remaining_days(int month, int day, int year);`           |


## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Multiple mains**
  * [0-main.c](./0-main.c): C file that  test for a postitive_or_negative() 

* **1. Like, Comment, Subscribe**
  * [1-main.c](./1-main.c): C fille comments out the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop. 

* **2. 0 > 972?**
  * [2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c): C function that prints the largest of three integers.

* **3. Leap year**
  * [3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c): C function that converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
